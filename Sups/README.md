sups (for simple ups) is a small application that allows you to do quick queries on usb connected UPS devices with 0 (or minimal) configuration.

It is not meant as a complete replacement for APCUPSD or NUT (or the vendor provided software) 

sups focuses on being flexible and easy to use for simple or complex everyday UPS scenarios. 

APCUPSD or NUT work like a charm for low level things like battery calibration of specific UPS devices, but are difficult to work with when you need to define complex everyday scenarios, like reading multiple UPSs and shutting down multiple remote devices on separate predefined battery levels in case of a power outage.

sups focuses and excels exactly on those scenarios. It is designed to be simple and flexible enough to allow you to define complex use cases by just calling the app multiple times with different arguments.
